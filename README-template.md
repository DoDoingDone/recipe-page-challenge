Frontend mentor challenge trying mobile-first layout

# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page solution

## Overview

I probably should have started with some of the other newbie challenges first, though I enjoyed trying this one. It was a challenge for me as I'm very new to responsive design. I know this is a rough first attempt, so any pointers on semantic HTML, as well as repsonsive design are greatly appreciated.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The difference in doing desktop-first versus mobile-first design is in the details!
Making a layout for each planned screen size will be helpful moving forward, especially with more complex layouts.

### Continued development

I want to try all of the newbie challenges to get my confidence up in coding. Working on improving my semantic HTML and CSS are at the top of the list, as well as improving my responsive design. I'm holding off learning anything like Tailwinds or Bootstrap until I feel solid in those skills.
